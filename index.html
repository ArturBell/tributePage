      <p>In summer 1929, several members of Europe's surrealist art society descended on the coastal town of Cadaqués, in the Catalonia region of northeast Spain, to meet with a promising young painter named Salvador Dalí.p <br>
Dalí had signed on for what was to be his first solo exhibition in Paris in November, but he was displaying all sorts of odd behavior, including uncontrollable fits of laughter. The visiting group, which included French poet Paul Éluard, worried that the talented but eccentric artist would be unable to focus on finishing enough pieces to fill the gallery space. <br>
Dalí seemed intrigued by Éluard's Russian wife, born Elena Dmitrievna Diakonova but known simply as Gala, so she was tasked with communicating with their host. Gala weathered his jarring outbursts, realizing they stemmed from social awkwardness, and, eventually, the laughing fits disappeared. In the meantime, she discerned him to be a true visionary and capable of spurring, as he theorized in his autobiography The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, the "fulfillment of her own myth." <br>
When Éluard announced it was time to return to Paris a few weeks later, Gala declared she was staying. With their open marriage, Éluard figured it was just a matter of time before she tired of her new companion, never imagining that it would only happen after she'd helped him become one of the iconic artists of the 20th century. <br>
As described in Tim McGirk's Wicked Lady: Salvador Dalí's Muse, the artist managed to buckle down and produce the quality paintings needed to make his November 1929 exhibition a success. But he wasn't around to experience it: He had run off with Gala on a "honeymoon" that took them to Barcelona and then another Spanish beach town. <br>
The pair soon moved to Port Lligat, outside Cadaqués, where their difficulties began. The fishing hut purchased with Salvador's meager funds initially had no light, heat or running water. Furthermore, Salvador's relationship with his father and sister frayed over his new girlfriend, who was 10 years his senior and a married mother. The family friends in the area were hostile to the new couple as well. <br>
Gala endured poverty and a series of health scares—she had a lung tumor removed and underwent a brutal hysterectomy—and undertook the task of boosting Salvador's career. She read to him to stimulate his mind, posed for paintings and offered honest critiques of the works in progress. Known to consult Tarot cards for direction, the woman with "eyes that pierced walls" was shrewd and firm in business dealings, and she aggressively promoted his output to affluent benefactors. <br>
Gala also endured what is believed to have been a chaste physical relationship with the artist. In his own words, he was "terrified" of female genitalia, and any attempts at lovemaking were stilted and unfulfilling for both. Facing no such hang-ups with her own healthy libido, Gala simply satisfied her desires with other men, including her ex-husband Éluard. <br>
It was an arrangement that worked for the couple, who found their mutual passion channeled into Salvador's exquisite works, and they were married in a civil ceremony in January 1934.
